Code documentation is an important part of software development, providing important information about your code to other developers, stakeholders, and users. It makes 
code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.A document can contain a variety of information, such as:
* **The purpose**: A description of the purpose of the code and the problem it solves.
* **Requirements**: A list of dependencies, configurations, and tools required to run your code.
* **Structure**: A description of the components of the code and how they fit together. 
* **Design**: A discussion of code design patterns, architecture, and implementation decisions.
* **Use**: Instructions for running the code and using its functionality, including inputs and outputs.
* **Example**: Sample code snippets and usage scenarios to help users understand how to use the code.
* **Limit**: A list of known limitations and limitations of the code.
* **Maintenance**: Information about code maintenance and updates, including bug reports and resolution steps. Good documentation makes your code accessible and easy to use 
for others, even if they weren't involved in the original development. It also helps you avoid bugs and errors by clearly explaining the behavior and structure of your 
code. Additionally, well-documented code becomes easier to maintain and update over time, making it more valuable and reusable.

It is important to update and maintain the documentation regularly as the code evolves. This keeps the documentation accurate and relevant, and helps avoid confusion and 
misunderstandings about how your code works. In summary, documentation is an important part of software development and helps make your code more accessible, 
user-friendly, and maintainable. Spending time and effort documenting your code pays off in the long run by saving time and reducing frustration for both the original 
developer and future users.
