# Random Forest Classfier 
Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is a machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to classify data into different 
classes. Train multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data obtained by random sampling with replacement and combine their predictions to produce 
a final prediction. In RFC, two key concepts of his, bagging (bootstrap aggregation) and feature importance, are used to reduce overfitting and improve model accuracy. 
It is a robust and flexible algorithm that works well with a large number of functions and is widely used for both classification and regression problems. 
$$Gini(S) = 1 - ∑ (p_i)^2$$
$$Entropy(S) = - ∑ p_i log2(p_i)$$
